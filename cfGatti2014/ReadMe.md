## Re-re-analysis of Gatti et al. (2014) results

The R/qtl2 results for the Gatti et al. (2014) paper had a number of
differences from the original (Fig 5 of Gatti et al. 2014). In the
current directory, we seek to double-check at least part of the
results using the original genotype probabilities from Gatti et al.
(2014).
